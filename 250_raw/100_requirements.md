# Required Raw Footage{id=requiredraw}

There are some situations, in which raw footage is **required**. First, *players must include raw footage whenever they submit a record
without audible clicks to the list*. The only exception to this guideline is for Everyplay recordings on iOS- no raw footage is required **in only this
case**. 

Players are also *strongly encouraged* to provide raw footage for their first submission, and are required to do so whenever any list team member requests it. Unless this first record features evidence of obvious legitimacy, such as streams, multiple progress videos, and/or a handcam, we will usually still ask for raw footage and **may reject the record** if no such footage is provided in the submission. 

If a player is unable to provide valid raw footage for a record when requested, the record will be rejected.
