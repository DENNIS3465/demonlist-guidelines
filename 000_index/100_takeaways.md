# Key Takeaways for Players{id=takeaways}

This section of the guidelines simplifies the most important points for players to know before playing a list demon or submitting a record. **Players are responsible for keeping each of these points in mind whenever they are applicable!** 

Players should also refer to the [player checklist](/guidelines/miscellaneous/#checklist) for a more concise list of important points to keep in mind.

Please note that if there is ever a conflict between these points and the full guidelines, *the guidelines always take precedence*.

## Submissions

- Submitted records can correspond to a player *completing a level* or *achieving progress above its minimum requirement*. The minimum requirement for a given list demon can be found in that level's page on Pointercrate. 

- Players should submit **their own records** and include an uncut video of their progress or completion run. The video should be available on YouTube, Twitch, Vimeo, Everyplay, or Bilibili; Pointercrate does not support any other video-sharing platforms! [More Details](/guidelines/eligibility/#videoreqs)

- To check the status of your submission, players should re-submit the same record using the form on the [Demon List](/demonlist)!

- A player has **three days** to respond to a team member's question about a record before that record is automatically rejected. The record will be reconsidered if the player reaches out to a team member after this deadline.

## Raw Footage

- Raw Footage is **required** for all records without clicks and **strongly encouraged** for all first submissions to the list. Raw footage is defined as the unedited recording of the session, either from a recording software or a livestream. 

- If a video for a record was not streamed and does not have audible clicks or a handcam, it has a **very high likelihood of being rejected** due to high suspicion!

- Players that wish to submit raw footage **must** provide it in the 'Notes' section of the submission form or in the video description. ***We will seldom reach out to you if we need raw footage and you did not provide it to us!*** [More Details](/guidelines/raw/#raw-footage)

- Records on mobile devices have [slightly different](/guidelines/raw/#raw-footage-on-mobile) raw footage guidelines due to natural limitations of the device.

## Eligibility

- The run for any record must start at the beginning of the level and last until the submitted progress value. Exiting the level midway through an attempt or using one attempt in Practice Mode does not disqualify a record!

- Using a skip that does not bypass entire sections of the level or alter the level's hardest parts is generally acceptable, but players should take note of whether the skip is still possible in the rated version of the level. [More Details](/guidelines/eligibility/#skips)

- 100% records that do not show the in-game endscreen will not be eligible for the list, unless the game crashes before the endscreen is displayed.

## Bannable Offenses

- Records using disallowed hacks will not be added to the list, and players that pass off these records as legitimate will be banned until they confess to hacking. Refusing to provide evidence for legitimacy is also grounds for a ban. 

- [This list](/guidelines/miscellaneous/#allowed-hacks) details the hacks we allow for list records, and [this section](/guidelines/eligibility/#hacks) more specifically outlines the retributions against hacked records. 

- Players are not allowed to collectively submit records for a single account! [More Details](/guidelines/eligibility/#hacks)

## Framerate and FPS Counters

- Players may use their monitor's refresh rate or a third-party software at a framerate of up to 300FPS. However, players that can prove ownership of a 360Hz monitor may use it for their records. [More Details](/guidelines/eligibility/#fps)

- An FPS counter is **required** if the player uses the No Pulse hack, achieves the run in Practice Mode, or submits a record for a level that uses an in-game "official" song. [More Details](/guidelines/eligibility/#fps)


## Fixing Bugs

- Players are generally allowed to fix bugs that are caused by varying refresh rates or in-game physics changes, especially if the level is made unreasonably more difficult or impossible as a result. 

- Submitting illegal bugfixes repeatedly without clearing them with the team may result in a player ban! [More Details](/guidelines/eligibility/#bugfixes)

## LDMs, Texture Packs, and the Smooth Fix

- Low Detail Modes (LDMs) that are built into the original level or uploaded to the Pointercrate account are always eligible for records. Players may also choose to create their own LDMs, but should clear them with the list team in advance. [More Details](/guidelines/ldms/#custom-ldms)

- Using the Smooth Fix to significantly slow down the game is not permitted. In addition, texture packs that visibly alter hitboxes *other than that of the player itself* are not permitted.
