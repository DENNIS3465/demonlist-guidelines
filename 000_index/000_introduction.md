# Pointercrate Rules and Guidelines

This section of Pointercrate documents the guidelines that the Demon List team uses when handling level placements and record submissions. Please note that these guidelines are **not necessarily exhaustive** and may receive updates. These updates are enforced **immediately** after their release, so players should take care to read the [changelog](/guidelines/#changelog) to familiarize themselves with any recent changes or additions.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding these guidelines, don't hesitate to contact any team member for clarification! The raw files used to generate this page are also located [on GitHub](https://github.com/stadust/demonlist-guidelines), so if you notice a typo or any other error, feel free to submit a pull request!
