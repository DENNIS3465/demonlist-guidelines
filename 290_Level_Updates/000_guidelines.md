# Records After Level Updates

An update to a level that alters its difficulty will cause all existing records for the level to be removed **if and only if the level is harder enough to be raised on the list**. All records will be maintained if the level maintains a similar difficulty or is nerfed to an easier state (e.g. WOW). 

If an update does not change the difficulty of the level enough for it to be raised or lowered on the list, *all previous versions will still be accepted*. The only exceptions to this are the cases of [Type II skips](/guidelines/eligibility/#skips) getting patched or [LDMs on the Pointercrate account](/guidelines/lowdetailmodes/#existing-ldms) getting removed from the servers.

It should be noted that this guideline does not necessarily apply for the current hardest demon, because it cannot be raised any higher. Updates that increase the difficulty of the demon at #1 will be handled on a case-by-case basis in regard to keeping or removing existing records.
