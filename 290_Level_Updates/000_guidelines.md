# Records After Level Updates

An update to a level that significantly increases its difficulty will cause all existing records for the level to be removed. Records will be maintained if the level maintains a similar difficulty or is nerfed (e.g. WOW).

Any update to a level which changes its difficulty will *invalidate all previous versions* for future records on the list. Previous versions for levels that receive minor updates, such as those that fix bugs in the gameplay, will still be acceptable for list records. The only exception to this is the case of [Type II skips](/guidelines/eligibility/#skips) getting patched.
