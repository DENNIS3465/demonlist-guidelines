# Raw Footage

The submission form on this website includes a Raw Footage section in which players may include additional information regarding their records. Players are expected - **and in some cases, required** - to provide raw footage in this section to support their legitimacy. Players may also include a link to raw footage in the description of the submitted video; however, please be sure to include a note directing the team member to where they may find your raw footage! 
  
To reiterate - **We expect players to provide raw footage that follow the guidelines below for every record they submit. In addition to the standard requirements, we reserve the right to require raw footage if we are not comfortable with approving the record without it. By not providing raw footage, you acknowledge that __you do not have any to provide__, and you recognize the possibility of your record getting rejected!**

## Definition

Raw footage is one of the most important aspects of ensuring that a record can be added to the list, so players should keep in mind the definitions and guidelines that apply to it! In general, “raw footage” is defined as the **original file taken from the player’s recording software**, without any edits, trims, or anything else modifying the file. These edits include but are not limited to trimming the video, editing in the in-game music, and compressing the file in any way.  

## Censorship

If the raw footage contains any cuts or splices in the video or audio, it will usually be rendered invalid and will not be considered when evaluating the corresponding record. However, *minor edits* such as censoring or blurring offensive language or personal information are permitted.
