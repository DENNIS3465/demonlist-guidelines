# Raw Footage

The submission form on this website includes a Notes section in which players may include additional information regarding their records. Players are encouraged - and in some cases required - to provide raw footage in this section to support their legitimacy. Players may also include a link to raw footage in the description of the submitted video. 

## Definition

Raw footage is defined as an *unedited recording of the game session*, which can be either an uploaded file from a recording software or a stream link from YouTube or Twitch.  Although any form of raw footage may be acceptable for list records, stream links are preferred, as most methods of hacking are significantly harder on stream. *This guideline does not guarantee that records with stream links will be accepted!*

## Censorship

If the "raw footage" contains any significant cuts or splices in the video or audio, it will be rendered invalid and will not be considered when evaluating the corresponding record. However, *minor edits* such as censoring or blurring offensive language or personal information are permitted.

## Player Responsibility

***It is up to the player to include raw footage with every record they submit. By not including raw footage anywhere in the submission, you acknowledge that you do not have any raw footage to provide!*** 

Especially for newer players, the list team uses raw footage as an early measure of trustworthiness, so unless you have several accepted records already, please be sure to provide raw footage for every submission- just in case!
