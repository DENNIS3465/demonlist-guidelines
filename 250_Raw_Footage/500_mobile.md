# Raw Footage on Mobile

## Proving a Mobile Record

For players using a mobile device, they do not have access to as many methods of proof as a PC player, so their submissions guidelines are notably different. 

A player must be able to *prove that a mobile device is in use* for these guidelines to be applicable. Common methods of proof for mobile devices include showing a mobile recording software (e.g. Everyplay, Mobizen, etc.) or showing “circle taps” on an Android device.

## iOS Devices and Everyplay

In addition to the normal restrictions of a mobile device, the iOS operating system is notorious for imposing even stricter limitations. However, the Everyplay service only functions properly on iOS, so an Everyplay recording is sufficient for all iOS records. 

Players that use iOS may also opt to use a separate screen recorder or stream to YouTube or Twitch, but please note that raw footage may be requested in these cases. 

Although Everyplay is known to not work correctly on Android devices, players can still access Everyplay footage using more unconventional methods. As such, *players must be able to prove that they use an iOS device* in order for an Everyplay record to get accepted without raw footage. The recommended method of proof is displaying an iOS menu in the video without any cuts.

## Android Devices

Everyplay is not available for Geometry Dash on Android, and Android users have greater accessibility to hacking methods compared to iOS users. As such, players with Android devices should be sure to prove their legitimacy with methods such as tapping the screen audibly, streaming, or filming the screen with an external camera. 

*Android records without audible taps or raw footage are still likely to get rejected.* In regard to raw footage, a stream link for any mobile record will be considered valid as long as it can be shown to not be pre-recorded, such as with chat interactions.
