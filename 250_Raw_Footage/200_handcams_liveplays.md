# Handcams and Liveplays

## Handcams

Although the list team does not require it for most levels, raw footage may also contain a handcam. A handcam for this purpose is defined as a clear, continuous view of the player’s input device (e.g. a mouse) during the majority of the session. Raw footage with a handcam will *greatly support the player’s legitimacy* because they are considerably difficult to fake in a hacked record.

In order to verify that a record was achieved by a single player, **levels using the 2-player gamemode require a handcam to be present throughout raw footage!**

## Liveplays

Similarly, raw footage may include a "liveplay", in which an external camera *records the computer screen for the entire session*. Liveplays will be considered as additional evidence for a record **only if the input device is visible** during the majority of the recording. Liveplays that do not show an input device will not necessarily be rejected; they will simply be considered equivalent to a screen-recorded video. Similarly to a handcam, including a valid liveplay as raw footage will greatly support the legitimacy of a record.
  
Players that wish to record liveplays should be aware that poor viewing angles could result in low visibility of the monitor screen. This may result in a rejected record, even if it is otherwise legitimate. If you have any concerns regarding the visibility of a liveplay setup, please do not hesitate to reach out to a team member for assistance!
