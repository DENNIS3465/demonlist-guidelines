# Handcams and Liveplays

## Handcams

Although the list team will never require it, raw footage may also contain a handcam. A handcam for this purpose is defined as a clear, continuous view of the player’s input device (e.g. a mouse) during the majority of the session. Raw footage with a handcam will *greatly support the player’s legitimacy* because they are considerably difficult to fake in a hacked record.

## Liveplays

Similarly, raw footage may include a "liveplay", in which an external camera *records the computer screen for the entire session*. Liveplays will be considered **only if the input device is visible** during the majority of the recording; without this restriction, the player could just externally record a hacked video. Similarly to a handcam, including a liveplay as raw footage will also support the legitimacy of a record.
