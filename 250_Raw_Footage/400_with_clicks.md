# Raw Footage With Clicks{id=rawclicks}

For records *with* audible clicks, players are still encouraged to provide raw footage with their submission whenever possible to avoid rejected records whenever the list team requests it. 

However, based on factors such as the playerâ€™s ban history or the number of accepted records under their name, raw footage is not always necessary for an submitted record with clicks. *Players are still required to provide raw footage if it is requested.*
