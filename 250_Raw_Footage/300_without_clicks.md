# Raw Footage - No Clicks{id=rawnoclicks}

For records *without* audible clicks, it is __strongly recommended__ to include raw footage with a handcam or liveplay of the session. Failure to follow this guideline significantly increases the likelihood of a rejected record [due to high suspicion](/guidelines/ucs). 

More specifically, due to the ability of players to fake raw footage without clicks, any record without clicks that also does not include a handcam or livestream (not to be confused with a liveplay) has a very high likelihood of getting rejected. Please note, however, that a player **will not be banned from the list** unless conclusive evidence for [hacking](/guidelines/hacks) is discovered.  

This guideline also applies to records with clicks that are *barely audible to the viewer*. As such, players that use a __controller__ or any other quiet input device for their recordings are advised to use a handcam or liveplay, as audible clicks may be very difficult to detect.
