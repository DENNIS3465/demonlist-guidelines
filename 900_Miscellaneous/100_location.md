# Using the Location Feature{id=location}

The [User Area](/login) on this website includes a player location feature, in which players may select a particular location to be associated with their name on the Stats Viewer. Additionally, players may also contact a moderator to change their location manually if they would like to.

Any abuse of this system (e.g. blatantly fabricating your location) will result in *permanent exclusion from this feature*.
