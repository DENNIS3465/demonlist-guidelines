# Updates to Guidelines{id=updates}

Over time, we are likely to update guidelines that a record must follow to qualify for the list. However, **the list team will almost never retroactively reject old records** following a guidelines update, as it would not be fair to record holders who followed the guidelines in place at the time. Any major guidelines updates will be announced in our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/demonlist), so join there to stay up to date!
