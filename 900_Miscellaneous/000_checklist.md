# Player Checklist{id=checklist}

Although the [key takeaways](/guidelines/index/#takeaways) in these guidelines are still important for players to know, this checklist summarizes the most essential steps players should take to maximize their chances of getting their record approved!

- If you can, complete the level on the rated version on the servers or on an "official" copy uploaded to the Pointercrate account.<br><br>
- If you need to beat the level on a copy for any reason, clear it with the list team first! This includes but is not limited to [LDMs](/guidelines/lowdetailmodes/) and [bug fixes](/guidelines/eligibility/#bugfixes).<br><br>
- If you'd like to use a skip, check to see if it's used in a completion already accepted to the list. If not, please get it approved by the list team before proceeding!<br><br>
- Do not skip the endscreen after a completion! This will warrant an immediate rejection of your record.<br><br>
- If you're using the No Pulse hack, or are playing a level with an "official" in-game song, be sure to turn on an FPS counter!<br><br>
- Include raw footage with your record, especially if it's your first time submitting or don't have clicks!<br><br>
- If you don't provide raw footage with your submission, do not delete it until your record is accepted! If we need raw footage and it's not provided, we'll reject the record initially, but players can reach out to us to provide raw footage at any time if they have it.<br><br>
- If you plan on including clicks, be sure that they're clearly audible to the viewer! Barely audible clicks are considered equivalent to no clicks and require corresponding raw footage.<br><br>
- If you're recording a liveplay (e.g. with your phone camera), be sure to have the monitor screen and input device clearly visible in the video!
