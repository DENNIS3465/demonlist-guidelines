# Player Checklist{id=checklist}

Although the [key takeaways](/guidelines/index/#takeaways) are still important for players to know, this checklist summarizes the most essential steps players should take to minimize any delays in getting their record approved!

- Complete the level on the rated version on the servers or on an "official" copy uploaded to the Pointercrate account.<br><br>
- If you beat the level on a copy, clear it with the list team first! This includes but is not limited to [LDMs](/guidelines/lowdetailmodes/) and [bug fixes](/guidelines/eligibility/#bugfixes).<br><br>
- [Raw footage](/guidelines/rawfootage/) is **required for every submission!** Be sure to provide a [shared Google Drive link](/guidelines/rawfootage#requiredraw) to avoid any delays in accepting your record.<br><br>
- Always include click sounds in your raw footage! Failing to provide clicks **guarantees** that your record will be rejected.<br><br>
- Make sure that your click sounds are clearly audible and isolated in your raw footage (see [2TA requirements](/guidelines/miscellaneous#clicks)). Barely audible clicks are considered equivalent to no clicks and will result in a rejected record.<br><br>
- Do not skip the dropdown endscreen after a completion! This will warrant an immediate rejection of your record.<br><br>
- Be sure to enable a readable [FPS counter](/guidelines/eligibility#fps) for all records!<br><br>
- Users of Mega Hack and other mods are subject to [additional requirements](/guidelines/eligibility/#hacks)<br><br>
- If you record a liveplay (e.g. with your phone camera), make sure that your monitor screen is clearly visible! Any questions regarding liveplay visibility should be directed towards a member of the list team.
