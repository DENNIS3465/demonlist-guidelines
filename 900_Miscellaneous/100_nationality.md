# Using the Nationality Feature{id=nationality}

The Stats Viewer on this website includes a nationality feature, in which players may request a nationality to be associated with their name. 

Any abuse of this system (e.g. blatantly fabricating a country of origin) will result in *permanent exclusion from this feature*.
