# Recording Clicks{id=clicks}

Any record that does not include audible clicks throughout the corresponding attempt **will be rejected with no exception**, even if the lack of clicks is accidental. As such, it is important to determine a method of recording clicks that consistently works well with your playing setup!

Records are **required** to have **at least two distinct audio tracks** in order to be accepted. **Clicks must be on their own separate audio track** in order to satisfy this requirement. Every player is given a **one time exception** for this requirement. If you are having trouble setting up your recording software to use multiple audio tracks, please contact a team member for assistance!

Records with raw footage from **livestreams, liveplays, or mobile devices** are exempt from the above requirement. Providing a recording with two audio tracks along with one of these exemptions will *significantly support your legitimacy.* If you are unable to record with multiple audio tracks, you may also choose only record your clicks *without desktop audio* as well.

If you would like to use a secondary audio device to record your clicks, that is also permitted! Refer to the guidelines below for separately recording your clicks.

**Before submitting a record to the list**, players should be sure to test their recording setup in order to proactively fix any issues with recording clicks. If you are having trouble with recording audible clicks, please refer to the guidelines below or contact a team member for assistance!
  
Below are some examples of effective software for recording both video and clicks. You may choose to use other programs as well, but **be sure that the clicks are audible in the video file without any editing!**
  
For PC:
  
- OBS
- ShadowPlay
- Bandicam
- AMD ReLive
  
For Mobile:
  
- iOS Built-in Recorder 
- Record It! (iOS)
- Android Built-in Recorder, if available
- DU Recorder (Android)
- Mobizen (Android)
- XRecorder (Android)

## Separately Recording Clicks
  
In some cases, players may not be able to record audible clicks using a video recording software. The clicks could be difficult to hear due to a quiet input device, but we will **never** force a player to change their playstyle to qualify for records on the list!

In addition to the requirement above about two separate audio tracks, you are permitted to send a video to us with edited click volume. If you decide to do this, **please be sure you also send the unedited file as your raw footage!**

Another acceptable alternative for recording clicks in these cases is **using a separate audio recorder** placed closer to the input device. This method also helps to avoid cases of inaudible clicks due to a recording glitch. **Players that choose to separately record clicks should upload a Google Drive *folder* in the "Raw Footage" field containing both the unedited video and unedited audio!**
  
The preferred method of recording separate audio is using an external device, such as a cell phone. Audio recording software on PC is also permitted; however, players are **not allowed to use Audacity** for recording clicks!
