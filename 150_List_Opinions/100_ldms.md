# Low Detail Modes{id=ldms}

If a level contains a [built-in Low Detail Mode](/guidelines/lowdetailmodes/#existing-ldms) that makes it significantly easier, the list team will primarily consider opinions from players that use the LDM. This allows the list placement to correspond to the easiest "official" version of the level.
