# Eligibility of Hacks{id=hacks}

Although the list team allows certain hacks for records on the list, a player *may not submit a record obtained using hacks* designed to __alter or bypass__ the gameplay in any way. This guideline includes but is not limited to Noclip, GDBot/XBot/YBot, Macros, and Speedhacks. Please refer to [this section](/guidelines/miscellaneous/#allowed-hacks) for a list of allowed hacks for records on the Demon List.

## Player Bans

***Any attempt to post an illegitimate (hacked) record while passing it off as not hacked will cause the player to be banned from the stats viewer on this website.*** 

The ban *will be indefinite* until the player confesses to the list team and publicly identifies their illegitimate videos as hacked. In addition, a player publicly encouraging the use of these hacking methods *will be treated as if they submitted a record that used them*, so they will be banned accordingly. The length of the ban after confession is dependent on the severity of the infraction, as well as the playerâ€™s ban history. 

*Repeated infractions will very likely result in a permanent ban.*

## 'Qwer' Accounts

While not considered a hack, the list team also prohibits 'qwer' accounts that post records from multiple players under a single name. 

If multiple players are caught submitting records for a single account on the list, the group account will be banned permanently and the individual players recording the videos will be banned indefinitely until each one confesses.
