# Eligibility of Hacks{id=hacks}

Although the list team allows certain hacks for records on the list, players may not submit records obtained using hacks designed to affect the gameplay in any way. Please refer to [this section](/guidelines/miscellaneous/#allowed-hacks) for a list of allowed hacks for records on the Demon List.

Enabling or disabling allowed hacks to change the difficulty of the level is considered a loophole and will be rejected!

## Mega Hack v7{id=mhv7}

In addition to using only [allowed hacks](/guidelines/miscellaneous/#allowed-hacks), users of Mega Hack v7 and above are expected to follow additional requirements:
- Cheat indicator on endscreen must remain enabled (this should be enabled by default)
- The FPS counter built into Mega Hack must be enabled

## Player Bans

***Any player that posts an illegitimate (hacked) record while passing it off as legitimate will be banned from the stats viewer.*** 

Each ban *will be indefinite* until the player confesses to the list team and publicly identifies their illegitimate videos as hacked. In addition, a player publicly encouraging the use of any hacking methods *will be treated as if they submitted a record that used them*. The length of the ban after confession is primarily dependent on the severity of the infraction, the quantity of hacked records, and any attempts to prolong the investigation.

*Any player that continues to hack after or while being banned will be subject to significantly increased or permanent ban times.*

## Alternate and 'Qwer' Accounts

Alternate accounts are prohibited for players that have already submitted records under a different name. If a player is caught with more than one account on the list, the alternate account(s) will be removed, and the original account will be banned indefinitely until the owner publicly confesses.

In addition, the list team prohibits 'qwer' accounts that post records from multiple players under a single name. If multiple players are caught submitting records for a single account on the list, the account will be banned permanently and the players involved will be banned indefinitely until each one publicly confesses.
