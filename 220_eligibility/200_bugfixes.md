# Fixing Bugs{id=bugfixes}

Bug fixes may be acceptable for gameplay that is made *impossible or unreasonably more difficult* by physics changes or certain framerates. ***Players should always verify custom bug fixes with the list team before using them!***

## Illegal Bug Fixes

Be aware of the differences between bugs and general inconsistencies! Using illegal bug fixes will cause your record to be rejected.

Submitting an illegal bug fix alone is not grounds for a player ban; however, repeatedly submitting prohibited bug fixes prior to clearing them with the team *may result in a player ban*.

## Custom Speed Changes

Players are allowed to add speed changes at transitions to adjust the sync of the level **if and only if all difficulty remains unchanged**. Any player that manually adds speed changes to a level *should clear it with the List Team before submitting a record*.
