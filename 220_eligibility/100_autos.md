# Auto Removal{id=autos}

A player may not remove an auto section from a level *unless no inputs are required after them*. For instance, removing the end screen of a level to reduce lag is allowed only if no gameplay exists during or after it. 

In that regard, players should be aware of the length of the new level after removing an end screen. The length of the original level **should never be adjusted**, for any changes would artificially alter the value of any progress obtained.
