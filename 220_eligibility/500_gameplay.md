# Gameplay Changes{id=gameplay}

In general, records are not eligible for the list if the player changed the gameplay from its original state. However, [fixing bugs](/guidelines/eligibility/#bugfixes) is an important exception to this guideline. 

If a list demon uses the in-game two-player mode, *only completions by a single player* are permitted for records on the level.

Disallowed changes to the gameplay of a level are often classified as nerfs, which could pertain to an illegal bugfix or a significant alteration of the level’s decoration. The latter case includes [strong LDMs](/guidelines/lowdetailmodes) and significant changes to a level’s color palette.

## Endscreens

A completion video that does not show the **in-game endscreen** after completing the level will not be eligible for a record on the list, unless the player provides [raw footage](/guidelines/rawfootage) of the completion that includes this endscreen. However, if the game crashes before the endscreen is displayed, it will serve as an exception to this rule.

## Game Version

Although these changes are typically not significant, an in-game update may alter the physics of various gamemodes, which can change the difficulty of passing certain sections of list demons. Because of this inconsistency, **any record that was not achieved on the current version of the game** will not be accepted to the list.
