# Gameplay Changes{id=gameplay}

In general, records are not eligible for the list if the player changed the gameplay from its original state. However, [fixing bugs] is an important exception to this guideline. 

If a list demon uses the in-game two-player mode, *only completions by a single player* are permitted for records on the level.

Disallowed changes to the gameplay of a level are often classified as nerfs, which could pertain to an illegal bugfix or a significant alteration of the level’s decoration. The latter case includes [strong LDMs] and significant changes to a level’s color palette.

## Endscreens

A completion video that does not show the **in-game endscreen** after completing the level will not be eligible for a record on the list, unless the player provides [raw footage] of the completion that includes this endscreen. However, if the game crashes before the endscreen is displayed, it will serve as an exception to this rule.
