# Framerate Guidelines{id=fps}

Geometry Dash typically sets the maximum framerate to the monitor's natural refresh rate. However, software that increases the framerate of the game may be used, **but the framerate must remain at or below 300FPS**. Any record with a higher framerate will be considered hacked, and any player that lies about their framerate will be banned from the list. 

However, players that can *prove the posession of a 360Hz monitor* are exempt from this guideline and may submit records with a framerate of up to 360FPS. **Only players that own the monitor may use 360FPS** due to significant Low Detail Modes that would be necessary for the majority of other players to run it.

## FPS Counters

An FPS counter is optional in most cases, but the list team may request that any given player uses it if we are suspicious of a framerate that exceeds the set maximum. However, an FPS counter is **required** if a record:
- Features a single attempt in Practice Mode
- Uses the "No Pulse" hack
- Corresponds to a level that uses one of the in-game "official" songs (e.g. Clubstep)

Although we will reject records that do not have an FPS counter in these situations, the player **will not be banned** unless they attempt to lie about their framerate.
