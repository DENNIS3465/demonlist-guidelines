# Framerate Guidelines{id=fps}

Geometry Dash typically sets the maximum framerate to the monitor's natural refresh rate. However, software that increases the framerate of the game may be used, **but the framerate must remain at or below 360FPS**. Any record with a higher framerate will be considered hacked, and any player that lies about their framerate will be banned from the list. 

In addition, an FPS counter is **required** for any record that uses a framerate above 300FPS. 

Players are allowed to **change their framerate** midway through an attempt as long as it continues to follow the set maximum framerate of 360FPS.

## FPS Counters

An FPS counter is optional in most cases, but the list team may request that any given player uses it if we are suspicious of a framerate that exceeds the set maximum. However, an FPS counter is **required** if a record:

- Features a single attempt in Practice Mode
- Uses the "No Pulse" hack or otherwise has no orb pulses
- Corresponds to a level that uses one of the in-game "official" songs (e.g. Clubstep)
- Uses a framerate that exceeds 300FPS

Although we will reject records that do not have an FPS counter in these situations, the player **will not be banned** unless they attempt to lie about their framerate.
