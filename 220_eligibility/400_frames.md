# Framerate Guidelines{id=fps}

For Geometry Dash update 2.2 and beyond, players are permitted to use any framerate.

For any version released before 2.2, **framerate must remain at or below 360FPS** regardless of monitor refresh rate. Additionally, **players are not permitted to change FPS values midway through a record.**

## FPS Counters

A visible FPS counter is **required for every record submitted to the list.** Although we will reject records that do not have an FPS counter, a player **will not be banned** unless they attempt to lie about their framerate.
