Each record must include a video with uncut footage from the beginning of the level to a given progress point. For example, a record of 89% on a level must correspond to an uncut video from 0% to 89%. In addition, each record is **required** to include a link to **original raw footage** in the [Raw Footage](/guidelines/rawfootage) section of the submission form. As such, players may submit an edited video in the "Video" section as long as the raw footage meets all eligibility requirements. ***The list team will not accept a record with edited raw footage under any circumstances***. 
  
Players should also note that each submission must include a video or raw footage with **consistently audible clicks** during the corresponding attempt. More information and suggestions for recording clicks can be found [here](/guidelines/miscellaneous#clicks).

It should be noted that players who mistakenly exit the level midway through an attempt are *still eligible to submit a record as if they had died at the percentage they reached*. This guideline also applies to players that pause the game with the "Hide Pause Menu" hack enabled, as this hack is not allowed for list records. A run is also eligible for a record if it was achieved with a single attempt from 0% in Practice Mode.
