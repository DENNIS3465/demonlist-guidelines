# Video Content{id=videoreqs}

The video submitted for a record must include uncut footage from the beginning of the level to a given progress point. For example, a record of 89% on a level must correspond to an uncut video from 0% to 89%. However, players may not want unedited footage to be displayed on the website; they may also include an eligible video in the description of the one they submitted or in the 'Notes' section of the submission form. ***The list team will not accept a video with cuts midway through the run without raw footage under any circumstances***. 

It should be noted that players who mistakenly exit the level midway through an attempt are *still eligible to submit a record as if they had died at the percentage they reached*. A run is also eligible for a record if it was achieved with a single attempt from 0% in Practice Mode, **but in these cases, an FPS counter is required because orb pulses are turned off.**
