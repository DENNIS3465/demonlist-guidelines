# Video Content{id=videoreqs}

Each record must include a public video of the entire run. Players may submit an edited video as long as their raw footage meets all eligibility requirements.
  
Submissions must also include [raw footage](/guidelines/rawfootage) with **isolated and audible clicks**. More information about recording clicks can be found [here](/guidelines/miscellaneous#clicks).

Players who mistakenly exit the level or enable a banned hack midway through an attempt are *still eligible to submit a record as if they had died at the percentage they reached*. A run is also eligible for a record if it was achieved with a single attempt from 0% in Practice Mode.

## 2-Player Levels

Levels using the 2-player gamemode **require a handcam showing both inputs** to be present throughout the record attempt. This handcam must be present in the raw footage but may be excluded from the public video.
