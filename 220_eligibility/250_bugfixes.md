# Fixing Bugs{id=bugfixes}

In Geometry Dash, gameplay features such as jump rings and ramps are known to behave differently on higher refresh rates. As such, a level on the list may occasionally contain gameplay that is impossible on certain monitors. Fixing this gameplay does not affect the eligibility of a record as long as the intended difficulty is maintained *as accurately as possible*. 

This guideline also applies to gameplay made unreasonably more difficult compared to the verifier’s refresh rate, such as the 99% click in Heartbeat (no longer on the list, but this is a well-documented example). However, players should be aware of the difference between buggy gameplay and general inconsistencies.

## Illegal Bug Fixes

***Players should communicate with the list team as regularly as possible when creating custom bug fixes!*** Submitting an illegal bug fix alone is not grounds for a player ban; however, repeatedly submitting prohibited bug fixes prior to clearing them with the team *may result in a short ban*.

## Custom Speed Changes

Although this issue is not necessarily considered a “bug”, certain conditions may cause a level to desynchronize with the song, especially in longer levels. Players are allowed to add speed changes at transitions to adjust the sync of the level **if and only if all difficulty remains unchanged**. Any player that manually adds speed changes to a level *should clear it with the List Team before submitting a record*.

## Physics Changes

In updates 2.1 and 2.11, certain changes to the in-game physics made some existing levels impossible or unreasonably difficult to complete. One example is the trajectory of the UFO gamemode after activating a red jump ring. These bugs are generally fixable, but they are handled by the list team on a case-by-case basis.
