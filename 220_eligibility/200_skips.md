# Skips

A record may contain one or more skips throughout the level, and the record may be accepted or rejected based on the “severity” of the skip. The list team has divided skips within a level into *three distinct classifications*, ranging from insignificant orb skips to bypassing entire sections of the level. 

This subsection of the guidelines addresses the three "types" of skips in this regard, but **players are highly encouraged to check with the List Team before submitting a record that uses a skip!**

## Type I{id=type1}

A **Type I skip** either barely deviates from the intended route in regard to difficulty or makes the level harder than intended while keeping the player close to the original path. A "secret way" that features difficulty beyond that of the rest of the level is still **not considered a Type I skip** because of the significant deviation from the normal route. 

A Type I skip *will always be accepted*, even after it is patched in the level on the servers. An example of a Type I skip is 3% in Sakupen Hell.

## Type II{id=type2}

A **Type II skip** is notably more significant; for example, the skip may bypass a section of a level longer than just a click or two. However, they are not egregious enough to warrant rejection of a record, which is often the case when the difficulty does not significantly change. 

Type II skips will be accepted *unless they are patched in the level on the servers*; an example is 67-68% in Zaphkiel (previously allowed, but not anymore because it was fixed). Note that records previously accepted with a Type II skip will remain *unless its classification changes* (see below).

## Type III{id=type3}

A **Type III skip** is significant enough to warrant immediate rejection of a record that uses it, with no exception. This classification includes but is not limited to taking a "secret way" or bypassing the hardest part(s) of the level. 

An example of a Type III skip is 83% in Devil Vortex.

## Changing Skip Classifications{id=skipchanges}

Although this is uncommon, a variety of possible circumstances may prompt the List Team to reevaluate the classification of a skip. Records will only be removed if the corresponding skip is now considered a Type III, instead of II or I. 

Similarly, records using a skip may be subsequently added if it ends up being less severe than what our initial evaluation suggested.
