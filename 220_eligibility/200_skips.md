# Skips

Skips are divided into *three distinct classifications*, ranging from insignificant orb skips to bypassing entire sections of the level. The eligibility of any skip will be decided by the list team. **Players are highly encouraged to check with the List Team before using a skip!**

## Type I - Always Allowed{id=type1}

A **Type I skip** either barely affects difficulty or makes the level harder than intended while keeping the player on the normal path.

A Type I skip *will always be accepted*, even after it is patched in the level on the servers.

## Type II - Allowed if Not Patched{id=type2}

A **Type II skip** is longer or more significant than a Type I skip, but still does not significantly affect difficulty.

Type II skips will be accepted *unless they are patched in the level on the servers*. Note that records previously accepted with a Type II skip will remain on the list *unless its classification changes* (see below).

## Type III - Never Allowed{id=type3}

A **Type III skip** is significant enough to warrant rejecting a completion that uses it. This classification includes but is not limited to taking a "secret way" or bypassing the hardest part(s) of the level.

Players are still eligible to submit a progress record up to the percent they used a Type III skip.

## Changing Skip Classifications{id=skipchanges}

Although this is uncommon, the List Team may reevaluate the classification of a skip. Records will only be removed if the corresponding skip is now considered a Type III, instead of II or I. 

Similarly, records using a skip may be subsequently added if it ends up being less severe compared to our initial evaluation.
