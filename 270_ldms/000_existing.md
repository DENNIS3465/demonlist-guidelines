# Existing Low Detail Modes{id=existing-ldms}

## Built-In

Although a built-in Low Detail Mode (LDM) for a list demon may significantly decrease its difficulty, completing a level in an LDM that is already built into the rated version on the servers will always be eligible for a record on the list. 

**There are no exceptions to this guideline**, and as a result, the [placement of the level] will represent the easiest method of completing the unedited version on the servers. 

In addition, creators may seek to publish a separate LDM for a list demon that they hosted. 

Although they should aim to reduce the difficulty as little as possible, an LDM that was published by the level’s creator will always remain acceptable for records, provided that it continues to match the gameplay of the rated level on the servers (along with allowed [bug fixes]).

## Pointercrate Account

In addition to built-in LDMs, the list team has uploaded LDMs of several list demons on the Geometry Dash account named “Pointercrate.” Records on any level published on the Pointercrate account will always be eligible for addition to the list, given that the [other eligibility requirements] are satisfied.
