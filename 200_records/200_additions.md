# Adding a Record{id=additions}

When a player submits a record on Pointercrate, it is automatically assigned an ID number based on when it was submitted. Records are generally checked in ascending order of ID to ensure the records submitted less recently are checked first. 

However, the list team may occasionally add records to the list manually. These additions are __completely independent__ from the normal process of checking records, so seeing another playerâ€™s record getting added before yours does not necessarily mean your record was rejected. *Players can check the status of their record by re-submitting it on the website.*

## Under Consideration Records{id=uc}

A player may check the status of their submission and see that the record is **under consideration**. This classification means that the list team is not immediately sure whether the record is acceptable, and it **does not** necessarily mean that we're suspicious of hacking. [This section] delineates the possible causes for this additional review, and what you can do as a player to speed up the process. 

In many cases, the list team will reach out for additional information regarding a record marked as under consideration. *A player has **three days** to respond to such a request from a list team member before their record will be automatically rejected.* However, a player may still reach out to a team member after this deadline for their record to be reconsidered.
