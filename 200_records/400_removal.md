# Manual Record Removal

Any player who has records on the list may request for them to be removed at any time and for any reason. To prevent abuse of this system, records may not be re-added to the list for *two weeks* after their removal, and records may not be removed again for *two weeks* after they are re-added.

If the player is a verifier of one or more list demons, they will still be listed as such on the level pages. However, they will remain invisible on the stats viewer.

*Please be aware that the submission form will say that you are banned from the stats viewer if you have requested record removal.*
