# Submitting a Record{id=submissions}

In order to submit a record for any given progress on a level (including 100%), you must include a video that showcases yourself completing an [uncut] run. The progress for a submitted record on a level must also be greater than or equal to the minimum progress requirement for the level, which can be found on the levelâ€™s information screen on this website.

The video must be available on YouTube, Twitch, Vimeo, Everyplay, or Bilibili in order for it to be added to the list. Pointercrate does not currently support videos outside of these five sources, so **there are no exceptions to this guideline**. For Twitch in particular, stream archives are automatically removed after two weeks, so highlights are the only acceptable form of video proof. The links you provide must also be "well-formed" URLs; examples of proper formatting can be found in [this section](/documentation/index/#video) of the documentation. 

*Players are advised to exercise caution when privatising or removing a video from their channels*. If a list team member asks for additional proof for your completion and you do not have these videos available for sharing, it may be considered a [refusal to provide evidence] and could get all your standing records removed.

**Using the submission form to send records for other players is strongly discouraged.** Each submitter has an anonymous ID number, so we are able to detect any discrepancies. Any user that submits a record as a joke will be immediately banned from submitting any additional records. Please note, however, that this is not the same as a player ban from the stats viewer on Pointercrate.
