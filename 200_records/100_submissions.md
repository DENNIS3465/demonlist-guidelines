# Submitting a Record{id=submissions}

In order to submit a record for any given progress on a level (including 100%), you must include a video that showcases yourself completing an [uncut](/guidelines/eligibility/#videoreqs) run. The progress for a submitted record on a level must also be greater than or equal to the minimum progress requirement for the level, which can be found on the levelâ€™s information screen on this website.

The video must be available on YouTube, Twitch, Vimeo, Everyplay, or Bilibili in order for it to be added to the list. Pointercrate does not currently support videos outside of these five sources, so **there are no exceptions to this guideline**. For Twitch in particular, stream archives are automatically removed after two weeks, so highlights are the only acceptable form of video proof. The links you provide must also be "well-formed" URLs; examples of proper formatting can be found in [this section](/documentation/index/#video) of the documentation. 

*Players are advised to exercise caution when privatising or removing a video from their channels*. If a list team member asks for additional proof for your completion and you do not have these videos available for sharing, it may be considered a [refusal to provide evidence](/guidelines/eligibility/#uc-records) and could get all your standing records removed.

**Using the submission form to send records for other players is strongly discouraged.** Each submitter has an anonymous ID number, so we are able to detect any discrepancies. Any user that submits a record as a joke will be immediately banned from submitting any additional records. Please note, however, that this is not the same as a player ban from the stats viewer on Pointercrate.

## Legacy Records{id=legacy}

By default, the submission form on Pointercrate does **not** accept records for levels that have fallen off the extended list. However, players are permitted to submit records for Legacy demons that were achieved **before the level entered the Legacy List**. 

A record will be considered for addition if the timestamp on the corresponding video refers to a time in which the level was still on the Demon List. However, it is not possible for players to submit them using the submission form on the website, so the recommended way to send these to the list team is through [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/M7bDDQf). 

Although these records are usually much older than most submissions, ***all submitted records will be considered under modern submission guidelines***. As such, players should note that records that were eligible for the list at the time of completion *may not be eligible under today's standards*, and they would be rejected in this case.
