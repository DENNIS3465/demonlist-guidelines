# Timing of Placements

The list team strives to place list-worthy levels as efficiently as possible; we want to place them accurately without sacrificing too much time gathering opinions. In general, a level will not be placed within one week of getting rated in-game unless it has at least three victors with reliable and consistent opinions. 

If there is strong variation between existing opinions, the team will likely wait longer than one week to determine an accurate consensus. **The only exception to this guideline is if the level is widely regarded as the hardest demon in the game; we'll likely place it at #1 soon after it gets rated.**

After one week has passed, we'll continue to monitor the opinions of new victors in an effort to detect a consensus. If there are enough victors for us to determine a consensus with little variation, we will place the level promptly. More details regarding our analysis of opinion sheets can be found in [these guidelines](/guidelines/listopinions/#analysis).

Even if the level does not have a clear consensus, or if the opinions have a lot of variability, we may still place it if it becomes clear that no new victors will emerge anytime soon. We place levels in this manner to encourage more players to complete them for list points, but these placements are likely to change when we start seeing new victors with updated opinions. 

We will place a list-worthy level no more than **one month** after it gets rated in-game, even if it has little to no victors. Such levels are highly subject to change in the future as players eventually complete them. 

Please note that these guidelines does __not__ apply to levels with a hacked verification; the one-month timeline for a hacked level begins after it receives its first legitimate victor.
