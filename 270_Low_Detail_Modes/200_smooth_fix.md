# Using Smooth Fix{id=smooth-fix}

A completion which is significantly slowed by the in-game Smooth Fix option is considered equivalent to a speedhacked completion and therefore would not be eligible for a record on the list. 

However, as long as the player does not hide their use of Smooth Fix, a rejected record *will not result in the player getting banned*.
