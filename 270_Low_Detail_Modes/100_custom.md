# Custom LDMs

Players are *strongly advised* to clear any custom LDMs with the team before using them, especially if an LDM for the level already exists. Strong level LDMs may be considered nerfs, which violates our guidelines for [gameplay changes](/guidelines/eligibility/#gameplay).
  
Players may choose to play on a custom LDM created by someone else, but doing so **carries the risk of a rejected record**! Even if an LDM has been approved in the past, it is always recommended to ask the list team whether it is still acceptable. Players may refer to our [LDM spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FqcYP8IwYstIueKWnow9b_07tscVNZBYIZyv-2SrH4o/edit?usp=sharing) for a list of approved LDMs.

## Custom LDM Guidelines

A custom LDM may not *delete or otherwise alter any object that obstructs the playerâ€™s vision*. All gameplay must be kept exactly the same as the original level.

No part of the LDM should look visually "empty" compared to the original level.

Make sure that the length of the LDM is the same length as the original level when removing an endscreen.
